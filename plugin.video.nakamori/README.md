# Quick-and-Dirty install

## For instalation (tested on: Kodi 21.0 Omega):

1. Settings -> File manager -> Add source -> click <None> -> "https://shokunin.monogatari.pl/repo/" -> OK (but you can change name from "repo" to "nakamori" if you like)

    (back one time to "system" ex. backspace)

2. Add-ons > Install from zip -> repo (or whatever name you gave it) > repository.nakamori-x.y.z.zip

   __If you didn't install any other non-official add-ons kodi will ask you to go to settings and enable "unknown sources", just do that__   


4. (you should be still in) Add-ons > Install from repo > Nakamori Repository > Video add-ons > Nakamori


## Nakamori configuration ##

The first time you start Nakamori (as Video Add-on or Program) you will be asked for your Shoko Server connection parameters, most of the time the user was/is: Default password is left empty
Nakamori will try to connect to localhost (same machine as the one you are running Nakamori) shoko server port, if that will be unsuccessful you will be ask for IP and PORT on which Your Shoko Server is hosted
